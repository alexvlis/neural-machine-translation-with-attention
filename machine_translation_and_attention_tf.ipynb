    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "A neural machine translation (NMT) system reads in a source sentence using an *encoder*, and then uses a *decoder* to emit a translation. NMT models vary in terms of their exact architectures. A natural choice for sequential data is the recurrent neural network (RNN). Usually an RNN is used for both the encoder and decoder. The RNN models, however, differ in terms of: (a) directionality – unidirectional or bidirectional (whether they read the source sentence in forwards or forwards and backwards); (b) depth – single- or multi-layer; and (c) type – often either a vanilla RNN, a Long Short-term Memory (LSTM), or a gated recurrent unit (GRU).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will consider a deep multi-layer RNN which is bi-directional (it reads the input sequence both forwards and backwards) and uses LSTM units with attention. At a high level, the NMT model consists of two recurrent neural networks: the encoder recurrent network simply consumes the input source words without making any prediction; the decoder, on the other hand, processes the target sentence while predicting the next words.\n",

    "    <figcaption>**Figure 2.** Example of a neural machine translation system for translating a source sentence \"I am a student\" into a target sentence \"Je suis étudiant\".  Here, $<s>$ marks the start of the decoding process while $</s>$ tells the decoder to stop.\n",

We now go into the details of how the model deals with source and target sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Embedding\n",
    "Given the categorical nature of words, the model must first look up the source and target embeddings to retrieve the corresponding word representations. For this embedding layer to work, a vocabulary is first chosen for each language. Usually, a vocabulary size $V$ is selected, and only the most frequent $V$ words in the corpus are treated as unique. All other words are converted to an \"unknown\" token $<$UNK$>$ and all get the same embedding. The embedding weights, one set per language, are usually learned during training (but pretrained word embeddings may be used instead).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Encoder\n",
    "Once retrieved, the word embeddings are then fed as input into the main network, which consists of two multi-layer recurrent neural networks -- an encoder for the source language and a decoder for the target language. These two networks, in principle, can share the same weights; however, in practice, we often use two different sets of parameters (such models do a better job when fitting large training datasets). The encoder uses zero vectors as its starting states (before it sees the source sequence). In TensorFlow:\n",

Some people divide the loss by (`batch_size * num_time_steps`), which plays down the errors made on short sentences. More subtly, the same hyperparameters (applied to the former way) can't be used for the latter way. For example, if both approaches use SGD with a learning of `1.0`, the latter approach effectively uses a much smaller learning rate of `1 / num_time_steps`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to generate translations at test time\n",
    "\n",
    "While you're training your NMT models (and once you have trained models), you can obtain translations given previously unseen source sentences. At test time, we only have access to the source sentence; i.e., `encoder_inputs`. There are many ways to perform decoding given those inputs. Decoding methods include greedy, sampling, and beam-search decoding. Here, we will discuss the greedy decoding strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is simple and illustrated in Figure 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We still encode the source sentence in the same way as during training to obtain an `encoder_state`, and this `encoder_state` is used to initialize the decoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The decoding (translation) process is started as soon as the decoder receives a starting symbol $<$/s$>$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. For each timestep on the decoder side, we treat the recurrent network's output as a set of logits. We choose the most likely word, the id associated with the maximum logit value, as the emitted word (this is the \"greedy\" behavior). For example in Figure 3, the word \"moi\" has the highest translation probability in the first decoding step. We then feed this word as input to the next timestep. (At training time, however, we may feed in the true target as input to the next timestep in a process called *teacher forcing*.)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The process continues until the end-of-sentence marker $<$/s$>$ is produced as an output symbol.\n",

    "## Introduction to Attention\n",
    "\n",
    "The attention mechanism was first introduced by Bahdanau et al., 2015 [1] and then later refined by Luong et al., 2015 [2] and others. The key idea of the attention mechanism is to establish direct short-cut connections between the target and the source by paying \"attention\" to relevant source content as we translate (produce output tokens). A nice byproduct of the attention mechanism is an easy-to-visualize alignment matrix between the source and target sentences that we will visualize at the end of this notebook.\n",
    " \n",
    "Remember that in a vanilla seq2seq model, we pass the last source state $h_{s_{T_s}}$ from the encoder to the decoder when starting the decoding process. This works well for short and medium-length sentences; however, for long sentences, the single fixed-size hidden state becomes an information bottleneck. Instead of discarding all of the hidden states computed in the source RNN, the attention mechanism provides an approach that allows the decoder to peek at them (treating them as a dynamic memory of the source information). By doing so, the attention mechanism improves the translation of longer sentences. Nowadays, attention mechanisms are the *de facto* standard and have been successfully applied to many other tasks (including image caption generation, speech recognition, and text summarization).\n",

    "### How do we actually attend over the input sequence?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different ways of formalizing attention. These variants depend on the form of a *scoring* function and an *attention* function (and on whether the previous state of the decoder $h_{t_{i-1}}$ is used instead of $h_{t_{i}}$ in the scoring function as originally suggested in Bahdanau et al. (2015); **we will stick to using $h_{t_{i}}$** in this notebook). Luong et al. (2015) demonstrate that only a few choices actually matter:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, the basic form of attention, i.e., **direct connections between target and source**, needs to be present. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Second, it's important to **feed the attention vector to the next timestep** to inform the network about past attention decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Lastly, **choices of the scoring function** can often result in different performance. See Luong et al. (2015) for further details.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A general framework for computing attention\n",
    "\n",
    "The attention computation happens at every decoder time step. It consists of the following stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The current target (encoder) hidden state $h_{t_i}$ is compared with all source (decoder) states $h_{s_j}$ to derive *attention weights* $\\alpha_{ij}$.\n",
    "2. Based on the attention weights we compute a *context vector* $c_{i}$ as the weighted average of the source states.\n",
    "3. We combine the context vector $c_{i}$ with the current target hidden state $h_{s_j}$ to yield the final *attention vector* $a_t$.\n",
    "4. The attention vector $a_i$ is fed as an input to the next time step (*input feeding*). \n",
    "\n",
    "The first three steps can be summarized by the equations below:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\large\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\alpha_{ij} &= \\frac{\n",
    "    \\exp(\\text{score}(h_{t_i}, h_{s_j}))\n",
    "}{\n",
    "    \\sum_{k=1}^{T_s}{\\exp(\\text{score}(h_{t_i}, h_{s_k}))}\n",
    "} \\tag{attention weights} \\\\\\\\\n",
    "c_{i} &= \\sum_{j=1}^{T_s} \\alpha_{ij} h_{s_j} \\tag{context vector} \\\\\\\\\n",
    "a_{i} &= f(c_{i}, h_{t_i}) \\tag{attention vector} \\\\\\\\\n",
    "\\end{align*}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the function `score` is used to compare the target hidden state $h_{t_i}$ with each of the source hidden states $h_{s_j}$, and the result is normalized over the source timesteps $j = 1, \\dots, T_s$ to produce attention weights $\\alpha_{ij}$ (which define a distribution over source positions $j$ for a given source timestep $i$). (There are various choices of the scoring function; we will consider three below.) Note that we make use of the current decoder (or *target*) hidden state $h_{t_i}$, which is computed as a function of the previous hidden state $h_{t_{i-1}}$, the embedding of the input token $x_{i}$ (which is either the emission or the ground truth token from the previous timestep) using the standard formula for a recurrent cell. Optionally, in the case of *input feeding*, we combine $h_{t_{i-1}}$ with the context vector from the previous timestep, $c_{t_{i-1}}$ (which may require a change in the size of the kernel matrix, depending on how the combination is implemented). The encoder (or *source*) hidden states $h_{s_j}$ for $j=1, \\dots T_s$ are similarly the standard hidden state for a recurrent cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also vectorize the computation of the context vector $c_i$ for every target timestep as follows: Given the source hidden states $h_{s_1}, \\dots, h_{s_{T_s}}$, we construct a matrix $H_s$ of size `hidden_size` $\\times$ `input_seq_len` by stacking the source hidden states into columns. Attention allows us to dynamically weight certain timesteps of the input sequence in a fixed size vector $c_i$ by taking a convex combination of the columns of $H_s$. In particular, we calculate a nonzero and normalized attention weight vector $\\vec{\\alpha}_i = [\\alpha_{i1}, \\dots, \\alpha_{iT_s}]^T$ that weights the source hidden states in the computation\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\large c_i = H_s\\vec{\\alpha}_i~.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The attention vector $a_i$ is used to derive the softmax logits and thereafter the loss by transformation under a function $f$.The function $f$ is commonly the a concatenation followed by $\\tanh$ layer:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\large a_{i} = \\tanh(W_a[c_i; h_{t_i}])$$\n",
    "\n",
    "but could take other forms. We then compute the predictive distribution over output tokens as\n",

    "So due to the fact that I trained on my MacBookPro I didn't have enough time to train all models or fully train LSTMCellWithFeedForwardAttention. Therefore, I trained **LSTMCellWithDotProductAttention** and **LSTMCellWithBilinearAttention** to 5000 epochs. Bilinear attention is more computationally expensive due to the increased number of parameters. Thus, it takes longer to train and evaluate. LSTM with dot product attention achieved a slighly lower BLEU score on dev and test than the LSTM with bilinear attention. Although this may be attributed to the fact that Bilinear attention has more expressivity, it might also be random since 5000 epochs is too little for these models to approach convergence."
